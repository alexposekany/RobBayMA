## Notes

1. approximatelyEqualRel.cpp function needs copy right
taken from [1]

2. parameter su only stored in sampling iterations i.e. when diagnostics functions
need nrun as input use ndraw

## TODOs
[ ] please read and write data (csv, .RData, PDF) to the `data`-directory (best practice [2])
[ ] PKG_CXXFLAGS should be set via makefile or something similar [3]
